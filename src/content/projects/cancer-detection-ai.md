Our flagship cancer detection system leverages state-of-the-art deep learning to identify potential malignancies in medical imaging with unprecedented accuracy. The system has been trained on over 1 million medical images and validated across multiple healthcare institutions.

## Key Features
- Real-time analysis of CT, MRI, and X-ray images
- Integration with existing hospital PACS systems  
- Explainable AI providing confidence scores and highlighting regions of interest
- HIPAA-compliant data processing

## Impact
This system is currently being piloted at 5 major medical centers, with plans for broader deployment in 2025.
